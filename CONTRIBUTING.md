# Contributing to SP&RK

Thank you for considering contributing to SP&RK! We welcome contributions from everyone and value your efforts to help improve this project.

To ensure a smooth process for everyone, please review the following guidelines before getting started.

## ⚖️ Our Licensing Model & The CLA

SP&RK operates on a **dual-licensing model**. The core repository is entirely open-source under the **AGPLv3**, but we also offer commercial licenses for enterprise users who need to integrate SP&RK into closed-source products.

To make this model sustainable and legally secure, we require all contributors to sign our **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**. 
* By signing, you retain ownership of your code, but you grant us the necessary rights to use your contribution in both our open-source and commercial offerings.
* You can read the full agreement here: [CLA.md](CLA.md)

### How to Sign the CLA (It's Automated!)
You do not need to print or email any documents (unless you are an enterprise that requires a manual signature). We use an automated bot to handle this directly in GitHub:

1. Submit your Pull Request (PR) as you normally would.
2. The `CLA Assistant` bot will automatically comment on your PR and check if you have signed the CLA.
3. If you haven't signed yet, the bot will instruct you to leave a specific comment on the PR. Simply copy and paste the following exact phrase as a new comment:
   > **I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA**
4. The bot will verify your signature, update its status to green, and we will be able to review and merge your code!
