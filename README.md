**1. Open-Source License (AGPLv3)**
This software is free to use, modify, and distribute under the terms of the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0**. 
* **What this means:** If you use this code in your project, your entire project must also be open-sourced under a compatible license. This applies even if you are only offering your project as a service over a network (SaaS).

**2. Commercial License**
If you wish to use this software in a closed-source product, or if you cannot comply with the terms of the AGPLv3, you must purchase a commercial license. 

* **What this means:** A commercial license frees you from the copyleft requirements of the AGPL, allowing you to keep your codebase proprietary.
